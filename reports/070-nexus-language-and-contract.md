# 070 — nexus language design + criome-msg contract

*Claude Opus 4.7 · 2026-04-25 · synthesis of four parallel
research agents (edit semantics, query semantics, correctness/
static-checks, prior-art-and-differentiators) plus the
criome-msg contract that bridges nexusd ↔ criomed and carries
the full language. Per Li 2026-04-25: "first we need the logic
that will make nexus the greatest database edit-and-query
language ever made … and we need the contract that will create
this logic in rkyv messages into/from nexus (nexusd role), to
criomed."*

*This is a language-design exercise. The full eventual surface
is in scope; rung-1 subsetting is a later report's concern.*

---

## 1 · The thesis

Nexus is one language with two faces (edit + query) and a
single contract layer (criome-msg). The language is grounded
in three structural choices that compound:

1. **Position-defines-meaning.** No keywords. Records like
   `Sum`, `GroupBy`, `Limit`, `OrderBy`, `Patch`, `Retract`
   are Pascal-named records like any other; their semantic
   role comes from grammatical position, not from being
   reserved.
2. **Delimiter-family matrix.** Outer character picks family
   (`()` records, `{}` composites, `[]` bytes/code, `<>`
   flow); inner pipe-count picks abstraction level (0
   concrete, 1 pattern/abstracted, 2 scoped/committed). One
   uniform rule makes every future feature pre-learnable.
3. **Records as operators.** Aggregation, pagination,
   temporal scoping, projection — all records, applied by
   juxtaposition. No pipeline operator (`|` or `->`); no
   keyword separator. Operators are first-class values.

Plus the architecture-level commitments: slot-refs (not
content-hashes) for cross-record references; sema-is-local
(no global database; instances negotiate); intrinsic
categories; per-kind change logs; capability tokens carried
in messages; criomed as the validation gate (the
hallucination wall).

---

## 2 · Edit semantics

### 2.1 · The edit primitives

Five core verbs:

- **`Assert`** — introduce a new record at a slot. Validator
  runs the six-step pipeline; appends `ChangeLogEntry(Assert,
  None, new_hash)`; updates `SlotBinding`; cascades fire.
- **`Mutate`** — whole-record replacement at an existing
  slot. Single audit entry `ChangeLogEntry(Mutate, old_hash,
  new_hash)`. Not Retract+Assert internally — it preserves
  slot continuity for subscriptions.
- **`Retract`** — remove a record. Validator checks
  outstanding slot-refs from other records; rejects with a
  Diagnostic naming dependents if any. Succeeds → tombstone
  bit on `SlotBinding`; cascades re-derive any
  rule-derived dependents.
- **`Patch`** — surgical field-level edit at a path inside a
  record. Path is a sequence of segments (field name, list
  index, variant selector). Validator type-checks the new
  value against the field's `TypeRef`. One ChangeLogEntry
  per Patch (treated as Mutate with a finer-grained diff).
- **`TxnBatch`** — atomic envelope wrapping a sequence of
  Asserts/Mutates/Retracts/Patches. All-or-nothing; one
  Revision; one redb transaction.

The `~` sigil is shorthand for `Mutate` at the syntax layer
(parsed by nexusd into `MutateOp`). The `!` sigil at top-level
record position is shorthand for `Retract`. Inside a pattern,
`!` is negation. Same character; position-defines-meaning.

### 2.2 · Atomicity model

`{|| ... ||}` is the atomic-transaction delimiter. Inside, all
ops commit together or roll back together. The first error
halts the batch; reply names the failed op index. No partial-
commit / best-effort mode.

```nexus
{||
  (Assert (Struct :slot 50 :name "Point" :fields [...]))
  (Assert (Fn :slot 51 :name "distance" :param-type 50 :body [...]))
||}
```

Cross-record edits (e.g., adding a `Fn` and updating a
`Module` to include it) are author-explicit as two ops in
one batch. Cascade rules (Phase D+) can derive related
updates, but the primary edit stays author-stated.

### 2.3 · Pattern-driven edits — client-side loop

A pattern matches many records; "mutate all matches" is
**client-side, not language-level**. The author runs a Query,
then issues N Mutates inside `{|| ... ||}`. Reasons:

- Mechanism stays transparent — each mutation is its own
  audit entry.
- Nexus is a messaging language, not a workflow engine.
- Atomicity is preserved by the batch wrapper.

If performance later demands server-side batch-mutate, that
lands as a Pascal-named record `(MutateMatching pattern
{ field-changes })` — no new sigil.

### 2.4 · Concurrency

**Optimistic with explicit CAS.** Default: last-write-wins.
Adding `:expected-rev N` to a Mutate/Retract/Patch makes the
op a compare-and-swap — validator rejects if the slot's
current revision doesn't match. Single-writer at criomed
makes this cheap.

```nexus
(Mutate :slot 42 :expected-rev 100 { :field "new-value" })
```

Time-travel edits (asserting "as if it had been at rev N")
are forbidden by design — would invalidate slot-refs and
break causality. Temporal queries are read-only.

### 2.5 · Cross-instance edits — outside nexus

Sema is local. Nexus targets one criomed at a time. Asserting
to a remote criomed is a transport-layer concern (the client
dials a different nexusd). Cross-instance *coordination*
(quorum-signed proposals, federated agreement) is part of
the architecture (Phase 3+), but it's not a nexus syntax
concern — it lives in criome-msg as separate verbs that the
two criomeds exchange.

## 3 · Query semantics

### 3.1 · Pattern-and-pipeline shape

A query is a **pattern** followed by zero or more
**operator records**, optionally terminated by a
**projection shape**:

```nexus
<pattern> <op1> <op2> ... <opN> { <projection> }
```

- Pattern: `(| KindName :field-constraint @bind-name |)` —
  1-pipe parenthesis is the pattern abstraction level.
- Operators: Pascal-named records applied in sequence —
  `(Count)`, `(Sum @v)`, `(GroupBy @k (Sum @v))`,
  `(OrderBy (Desc @v))`, `(Limit 50)`, `(Distinct)`.
- Projection: `{ @bind-1 @bind-2 (Sum @v) }` — fields and
  aggregations to return.

Conjunction inside `{| ... |}` joins multiple patterns by
shared bind names (datalog-style):

```nexus
{|
  (| Fn @fn :module @mod |)
  (| Module @mod :visibility "public" |)
|}
{ @fn @mod }
```

`!` negates a pattern; `(|| ... ||)` is optional/LEFT-JOIN
(LEFT-JOIN that succeeds with `None` if no match).

### 3.2 · Operator catalogue

All Pascal-named records in `nexus::query::*` (or wherever
the schema places them):

- **Aggregation**: `Count`, `CountDistinct`, `Sum`, `Min`,
  `Max`, `Avg`.
- **Grouping**: `GroupBy { binds, inner-ops }`, `Having
  pattern`.
- **Ordering / pagination**: `OrderBy [(field, Asc|Desc)]`,
  `Limit N`, `Offset N`, `Top N op`, `Bottom N op`,
  `Before cursor`, `After cursor`.
- **Set operations**: `Distinct`, `DistinctBy @bind`,
  `Project [field-or-bind…]`.
- **Temporal** (Phase 2): `TimeAt rev-ref`, `TimeBetween
  rev-ref rev-ref`, `TimeAll`.
- **Cross-instance** (Phase 3 sketch): `RemoteInstance
  peer-id`.

All compose by nesting (records nest by definition):
`(Top 10 (GroupBy @module (Sum @bytes)))` is one nested
operator-record.

### 3.3 · Recursion + transitive closure

Two paths:

- **Phase 2 — rules** (`[|| head body ||]` form): user
  asserts a `Rule` record; criomed registers it; cascades
  derive transitive facts; subsequent queries pull derived
  records like any others. Stratified (per
  `KindDecl.stratum`) to guarantee termination.
- **Pre-Phase-2** — client-side iteration over forward
  closure. Acceptable for shallow chains.

### 3.4 · Streams / subscriptions — `<| ... |>`

Subscribe to a pattern; criomed streams diffs:

```nexus
<| (| Order @id @amount |) (After @cursor) (Limit 100) |>
```

Server delivers (over the wire) a sequence of:
`SubReady`, `SubSnapshot`, `SubAssert`, `SubMutate`,
`SubRetract`, `SubError`, `SubEnd`. Resumption from a known
revision; cursor-paginated. At-least-once semantics on the
default channel; at-most-once available with a flag (open
question).

### 3.5 · Introspection — schema-as-records

Sema's schema lives in sema as `KindDecl`, `FieldSpec`,
`CategoryDecl` records. Querying them needs no separate
language layer:

```nexus
(| KindDecl @kind :name "Fn" |) { @kind }
(| FieldSpec :kind @k :name "body" |) { @k }
```

This is the genesis-via-self property at the language level:
the language can describe itself in itself.

### 3.6 · Result shape

A query result is a stream of *bindings* (each match yields
a dict of `@name → value`). The `{ }` projection at the end
selects which fields/aggregations to return; if absent, all
binds are returned.

Nested results (for `GroupBy` etc.) are nested records:

```nexus
{ @customer { (Sum @amount) (Count) } }
```

Returns a stream of `{customer: ..., {Sum: ..., Count: ...}}`.

## 4 · Correctness story

### 4.1 · Three layers

| Layer | Where | What's caught | Failure mode |
|---|---|---|---|
| Parse | nota-serde-core in nexusd | syntax (delimiter balance, sigil budget, identifier shape, literal form) | `Reply::Rejected` (transient) |
| Validation | criomed's six-step pipeline | schema-mismatch, unresolved slot-refs, invariant violations, unauthorised actions, type errors | `Diagnostic` record in sema (durable) + `Reply::Rejected` summary |
| Execution | criomed's pattern matcher + cascade engine + rsc/rustc | non-linear pattern unification failures, cascade non-termination, rsc/rustc errors | `Diagnostic` record (durable); cascade-failure is diagnostic-only and does not reject the originating mutation |

Diagnostic codes E0000–E9999 are assigned per failure class
(E0000 parse, E0001 schema, E0002 ref, E0003 invariant,
E0004 unauthorised, E0005 expired-proposal, E0006
incomplete-quorum, E0007 invalid-signature, E9999 cascade).

### 4.2 · Schema-name resolution is validation-time

Parse-time has no sema access; the parser cannot know
whether `(Slot 3)` exists. Validation-time step 1 (schema-
check) looks up the kind by name in sema (or against
built-in Rust types during genesis). Mismatch → E0001.

### 4.3 · Reference correctness within transactions

Within `{|| op1 op2 ||}`, slot-refs in `op2` resolve against
*sema as it stood before the transaction*, not against what
`op1` would assert. **Intra-txn forward-refs are not
resolved.** If you need to assert a record and reference it
in the same call, split into two transactions:

```nexus
{|| (Assert (Point :slot 10 :x 1.0)) ||}
{|| (Assert (Circle :slot 11 :radius (Slot 10))) ||}
```

This is a deliberate constraint that simplifies the
validator and makes mechanism explainable. Open question:
relax later if real workflow demand surfaces.

### 4.4 · Pattern correctness

Patterns can be statically checked against `KindDecl` for
shape (does `:body` exist on `Fn`?). Lean: validate at
assertion-time of `Pattern` records (and `Rule` records
that contain patterns). Runtime pattern-evaluation only
emits Diagnostic on truly-dynamic problems (e.g.,
non-linear bind constraint failed during a particular
match).

Pattern linearity (repeated `@x` enforces equality) is a
runtime concern — the matcher unifies binds across
positions; mismatches fail the match silently (no emitted
record).

### 4.5 · Cascade-rule stratification

Stratification per `KindDecl.stratum` is a static check at
rule-assertion time: a rule may only read from strata ≤ its
head's stratum. Cycle detection at assertion time emits a
warning (not a rejection) for obvious cycles; runtime
infinite-loop detection emits `E9999` and times out the
cascade without rejecting the original assertion.

### 4.6 · Validate (dry-run) verb

A `Validate` request runs the full validator pipeline
without committing. Returns `Diagnostic`s + an optional
`ExecutionPlan` (for queries). Useful for editor/LSP
integration: pre-flight check before sending a real edit.

### 4.7 · Static-check tooling

- **Syntax-only**: `nexus-cli parse` (uses only nota-serde-
  core; no daemon).
- **Schema-aware**: `nexus-cli validate` against a cached
  schema snapshot.
- **Live**: `(Validate ...)` request to criomed.

## 5 · What nexus does that no one else does

Five distinguishing-by-design properties:

1. **Position-defines-meaning + delimiter-family matrix.** No
   keywords; one uniform abstraction-level rule. Future
   features extend without growing reserved-word lists or
   sigil budget. (SQL fails here; jq/Kusto succeed partially
   with `|`-pipelines but require keywords for operators.)

2. **Records as operators.** `(Sum @v)`, `(GroupBy @k)`,
   `(Limit 50)` are records — storable, queryable,
   serialisable like any other record. (GraphQL has typed
   schema but operators are syntax-keywords; EdgeQL is closer
   but still SQL-influenced.)

3. **Slot-refs separate identity from content.** Records
   reference each other by `Slot(u64)`; renames update the
   binding, not the hash; content edits don't ripple. (SQL
   foreign keys couple identity to PK fields; Datomic
   entity-id mixes identity with history.)

4. **Sema-is-local with rich cross-instance interaction.**
   No global database, no eventual-consistency illusion;
   instances communicate, agree, disagree, negotiate. Content-
   addressing makes record-sharing-by-hash tractable across
   machines. (Most distributed databases bury this in
   protocol layers; nexus exposes it as a first-class
   architectural concern with first-class language support
   coming in Phase 3.)

5. **Genesis-via-self.** The language can describe its own
   schema in itself (`KindDecl` records describe `KindDecl`).
   Bootstrap uses the same nexus-via-nexusd-via-criomed flow
   as any other input. No baked-in-rkyv shortcut, no internal-
   assert path. (Datomic's transaction-fn semantics are
   coded outside the database; SQL's system catalog is a
   separate language.)

## 6 · The criome-msg contract

The wire format that crosses nexusd ↔ criomed (and within
criomed → criomed cluster, sketched). Every wire message is
two rkyv archives concatenated: an archived `u32` (big-endian)
carrying the body length, then the archived `Frame`. All-rkyv
wire — no raw-byte primitives. Every field type below is
rkyv-archivable.

### 6.1 · Frame envelope

```rust
pub struct Frame {
    pub correlation_id: u64,              // request/reply pairing
    pub principal_hint: Option<Slot>,     // who's making this request (Slot → Principal)
    pub auth_proof: Option<AuthProof>,    // signature; None during single-operator MVP
    pub body: Body,
}

pub enum Body { Request(Request), Reply(Reply) }

pub enum AuthProof {
    SingleOperator,                       // accepted only on Unix-socket peer-cred check
    BlsSig { sig: BlsG1, signer: Slot },  // post-MVP single-principal sig
    QuorumProof { committed: Slot },      // post-MVP; refers to CommittedMutation record
}
```

    pub fields: Vec<(String, RawValue)>,
}

pub enum RawValue {

    SlotRef(Slot),                        // bare integer in nexus → SlotRef when target field is Slot-typed
    List(Vec<RawValue>),
    Record(Box<RawRecord>),
    Bytes(Vec<u8>),                       // # byte-literal
}

pub enum LiteralValue {
    U64(u64), I64(i64), F64(f64), Bool(bool), String(String),
    Bytes(Vec<u8>), Blake3(Blake3Hash),
    Slot(Slot), Revision(Revision),
}

pub struct Slot(pub u64);
pub struct Revision(pub u64);
pub struct Blake3Hash(pub [u8; 32]);
pub struct BlsG1(pub [u8; 48]);

pub enum FieldPath {
    Direct(String),                       // top-level field
    Nested(Vec<RawSegment>),              // nested path
}
```

### 6.7 · What this contract commits to

- **Kind names are wire-strings, resolved at validation.**
  Criomed looks up `KindDecl` from `kind_name` at step 1. No
  pre-resolved type IDs on the wire — the contract stays
  schema-evolution-friendly.
- **Slot-refs are bare `Slot(u64)`** on the wire; criomed
  resolves them against `SlotBinding`. Wire never carries
  content hashes for cross-record references — those live
  on the sema side, not in messages.
- **Diagnostics can be both transient (wire-only) and
  durable (asserted as records).** `durable_record:
  Option<Slot>` on `Diagnostic` flags which.
- **Subscriptions are multi-frame.** A single subscribe
  request triggers a stream of reply frames sharing the
  `subscription_id`. The correlation_id maps to the
  `SubReady` only.
- **TxnBatch is one Frame.** All ops travel in a single
  rkyv-archived frame; criomed processes the whole batch
  atomically.

## 7 · Nexusd's role — text ↔ rkyv

Nexusd:

1. Accepts nexus text on a UDS socket.
2. Lexes and parses with `nota-serde-core` at
   `Dialect::Nexus`.
3. Maps the parsed AST to a `Frame`:
   - Top-level form `(Assert ...)` → `Request::Assert(AssertOp{...})`.
   - `~(...)` sigil → `Request::Mutate(...)`.
   - `!record-form` → `Request::Retract(...)`.
   - `(Patch slot path value)` → `Request::Patch(...)`.
   - `{|| ... ||}` → `Request::TxnBatch(...)`.
   - `(Query pattern op1 op2 ...)` → `Request::Query(...)`
     with `Selection { pattern, operators, projection }`.
   - `<| pattern ops |>` → `Request::Subscribe(...)`.
   - `(Validate op)` → `Request::Validate(...)`.
4. Sends the rkyv-archived `Frame` to criomed over UDS.
5. Reads reply frames; serialises back to nexus text using
   the inverse mapping.
6. For `Subscribe` requests, holds the connection open and
   relays each reply frame as it arrives.

Nexusd holds no sema state. It does **syntactic** mapping
only; all semantic resolution happens at criomed.

The mapping is mechanical and explainable per nexus form.
This is the contract Li asked for.

Carried forward from the agents' reports plus this synthesis:

### Q1 · Subscription delivery semantics

At-least-once / at-most-once / exactly-once. Default
candidate: at-least-once with explicit ack frames; client
deduplicates by `subscription_id × event-rev`. Confirm or
override.

### Q2 · Pattern-driven mutate — server-side or client-side?

Lean: client-side loop inside `{|| ... ||}` (mechanism is
honest; audit trail per record). Server-side variant
`(MutateMatching pattern { fields })` reserved for future
performance need. Confirm.

### Q3 · Intra-transaction forward-refs

Lean: not supported (split into two transactions). Confirm,
or relax for ergonomic workflows.

### Q4 · Cascade non-termination — reject vs diagnostic

Lean: emit E9999 diagnostic, time out cascade, do not
reject the originating mutation. Confirm.

### Q5 · Cross-instance verbs in this contract or separate?

The current contract sketches `RemoteInstance` as a query
operator and adds `QuorumProof` to `AuthProof`. The bigger
cross-criomed protocol (signed proposals, hash-shared
records, federated subscriptions) is intentionally not in
this contract — it belongs in a peer-to-peer criome-net
contract. Confirm scope: criome-msg = local nexusd↔criomed
only; criome-net = criomed↔criomed peer.

### Q6 · Validate-verb's ExecutionPlan shape

The `ExecutionPlan` enum is a sketch. At what granularity do
we expose query plans? Lean: keep it coarse (Scan / Filter
/ Join / Aggregate / Sort / Limit) — enough for editor
hints without committing to optimiser internals.
