# Sema-ecosystem architecture

*Living document · last revision 2026-04-24 · canonical reference for the engine's shape*

## Scope rule (READ FIRST)

This file is **high-level concepts only**. Three layers of
documentation, strictly separated:

| Where | What | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `docs/architecture.md` | **Prose + diagrams only.** No code. High-level shape, invariants, relationships, rules. | "criomed owns sema; lojix-stored owns lojix-store; text crosses only at nexusd" |
| `reports/NNN-*.md` | **Concrete shapes + decision records.** Type sketches, record definitions, message enums, research syntheses, historical context. | `Opus { … }` full rkyv sketch |
| the repos themselves | **Implementation.** Rust code, tests, flakes, Cargo.toml. | `nexus-schema/src/opus.rs` |

**If a doc-layer rule is violated**, rewrite: move type sketches
out of `docs/architecture.md` into a report; move runnable code
out of reports into the appropriate repo. This file stays slim
so it remains readable in one pass.

When architecture changes, update this file first, then write a
new report explaining the change. Don't edit old reports —
they're decision-journey records.

## 1 · The engine in one paragraph

The engine is a **runtime (criome)** hosting two pillars — a
**records database (sema)** and an **artifacts family (lojix,
Li's expanded-and-more-correct nix)**. `criome` is the runtime
layer — four daemons (`nexusd` the messenger, `criomed` the
guardian, `lojix-forged` the compile daemon, `lojix-stored` the
blob guardian). `sema` owns records, schemas, patterns, query
ops — stored in a records database (`sema` crate) and described
by types in `nexus-schema`. `lojix` owns build, compile, store,
deploy — everything nix covers — with its own family of crates
(`lojix-schema`, `lojix-store`, `lojix-forge`, `lojix-deploy`,
…). `nexus` is the communication skin spanning all of criome:
text at the human boundary, rkyv internally. The MVP target is
**self-hosting**: the engine's own source lives as records in
sema; `lojix-forged` projects those records to Rust source and
compiles them; the resulting binary can re-edit its own records.

```

**Invariants**:

- Text crosses only at nexusd's boundary.
- No daemon-to-daemon path routes bulk data through criomed —
  forged and lojix-stored are connected directly, authorised by
  a criomed-signed capability token.
- Criomed never sees compiled binary bytes; it only records
  their hashes in sema.
- There is no `Launch` protocol message. Binaries are
  materialised to filesystem paths (nix-store style); you run
  them from a shell.

## 3 · The two stores

### sema — records database

- **Owner**: criomed.
- **Backend**: content-addressed records, keyed by the blake3
  of their canonical rkyv encoding. Storage engine is an
  embedded redb.
- **Holds**: every structural record (Struct, Enum, Module,
  Program, Opus, Derivation, Type, Origin, traits, …).
- **Writes**: single-writer through criomed's internal writer
  actor.
- **Reads**: parallel, MVCC semantics from the storage engine.
- **Identity of a workspace opus** tracked in a name→root-hash
  table (git-refs analogue).

### lojix-store — content-addressed blobs

- **Owner**: lojix-stored.
- **Backend**: append-only file plus a rebuildable hash-to-
  offset index.
- **Holds**: opaque bytes only (compiled binaries; user file
  attachments referenced by sema records; anything too large or
  too unstructured to belong in sema).
- **No typing**. No kind bytes. The type of a blob is known
  only through the sema record that references its hash.
- **Access control**: capability tokens, signed by criomed.

### Relationship

Sema records carry content-hash fields that reference blobs in
lojix-store. "Record says hash H; fetch H from lojix-stored."
Criomed keeps a reachability view (what hashes are live) and
can direct garbage collection; it never handles the bytes
themselves.

## 4 · Repo layout

~19 code repos plus `tools-documentation` (docs). **[L]**
marks lojix-family members.

- **Layer 0 — text grammars** — nota (spec), nota-serde-core
  (shared lexer+ser+de kernel), nota-serde (façade), nexus
  (spec), nexus-serde (façade).
- **Layer 1 — schema vocabulary** — nexus-schema (sema records,
  pattern types, query ops; may rename to `sema-schema` later),
  lojix-schema **[L]** (Opus, Derivation, nix newtypes like
  `NarHashSri` / `FlakeRef` / `TargetTriple`).
- **Layer 2 — contract crates** — criome-msg (nexusd↔criomed),
  lojix-forge-msg **[L]** (criomed↔lojix-forged), lojix-store-msg
  **[L]** (store traffic).
- **Layer 3 — storage** — sema (records DB), lojix-store **[L]**
  (blobs).
- **Layer 4 — daemons** — criomed (guardian), nexusd (messenger),
  lojix-forged **[L]** (compile daemon), lojix-stored **[L]**
  (blob daemon).
- **Layer 5 — clients + build libs** — nexus-cli (flag-less
  CLI), rsc (pure records-to-source library; lojix-forged uses
  it but it stays unprefixed), lojix-forge **[L]** (forge lib),
  lojix-deploy **[L]** (CriomOS deploy lib + CLI).

**Lojix family membership** is a second axis orthogonal to
layer. A crate is lojix-family iff it participates in the
content-addressed typed build/store/deploy pipeline (Li's
"expanded nix"). Criteria: carries `NarHashSri`/`FlakeRef`/
artifact records, or drives nix/cargo, or stores opaque blobs,
or is the typed wire for any of those.

### The `lojix-*` namespace — Li's expanded nix

"lojix" is Li's play on nix — "my take on an expanded and more
correct nix." Broad scope: covers everything nix covers
(compile, store, deploy, derive). The prefix is an umbrella; a
crate carrying `lojix-*` participates in the artifacts pillar.

Three-pillar framing:

- **criome** — the runtime (nexusd, criomed, the daemon graph)
- **sema** — records, meaning, schemas, patterns
- **lojix** — artifacts, build, compile, store, deploy

criome ⊇ {sema, lojix}. nexus is the communication skin spanning
all of criome, not a fourth pillar.

**Two axes per daemon**:

| Daemon | Runtime | Family |
|---|---|---|
| `nexusd` | criome | criome (nexus skin) |
| `criomed` | criome | criome |
| `lojix-forged` | criome | lojix |
| `lojix-stored` | criome | lojix |

All daemons run at criome-runtime; some are also lojix-family.

**Shelved**: `arbor` (prolly-tree versioning) — post-MVP.

Concrete record types, message enums, and the rename journey
live in [reports/019](../reports/019-lojix-as-pillar.md),
[reports/017](../reports/017-architecture-refinements.md), and
earlier. This file names the components; it does not define
their shapes.

---

## 5 · Key type families (named, not specified)

- **Opus** *(lojix)* — a pure-Rust artifact specification.
  Nix-like and extremely explicit: toolchain pinned by
  derivation reference, outputs enumerated (bin / lib / both),
  features as plain strings, every build-affecting input a
  field so the record's hash captures the full closure. Lives
  in `lojix-schema`.
- **Derivation** *(lojix)* — the escape hatch for non-pure
  deps. Wraps a nix flake output (or, rarely, an inline nix
  expression) with a content-hash and named outputs (`out`,
  `lib`, `dev`, `bin`). Lives in `lojix-schema`.
- **OpusDep** *(lojix)* — an opus references either another
  opus (recursive Rust build) or a derivation (system lib,
  tool) with a link specification describing how cargo/rustc
  should consume the derivation's outputs. Lives in
  `lojix-schema`.
- **RawPattern** — the wire form of a nexus pattern, carrying
  user-facing names (`StructName`, `FieldName`, `BindName`).
  Appears on criome-msg; never used inside criomed after
  resolution.
- **PatternExpr** — the resolved form, carrying schema IDs
  (`StructId`, `FieldId`). Pinned to a specific sema snapshot.
  Internal to criomed.
- **CriomeRequest / CriomeReply** — the nexusd↔criomed
  protocol verbs (lookup, query, assert, mutate, subscribe,
  compile, …).
- **CompileRequest / CompileReply** — the criomed↔lojix-forged
  protocol, carrying opus identity, sema snapshot, and a
  capability token. Lives in `lojix-forge-msg`.
- **LojixStoreRequest / LojixStoreReply** — put/get/contains,
  plus streaming variants for large blobs.

Concrete field lists live in
[reports/017 §1, §2](../reports/017-architecture-refinements.md)
and subsequent reports. If a type below needs to grow, update
its report (or write a new one); don't inline the shape here.

## 6 · Data flow

### Single query

```
 human nexus text
        ▼
  nexusd: lex + parse → RawPattern
        │ rkyv criome-msg (Query { pattern })
        ▼
  criomed: resolver(RawPattern, sema_snapshot) → PatternExpr
        │ matcher runs against records
        ▼
  rkyv reply (Records)
        ▼
  nexusd: serialize → nexus text
        ▼
 human
```

### Compile + self-host loop

```
 human: (Compile (Opus nexusd))
        ▼
 nexusd → criomed → lojix-forged (with capability token)
        │
        ▼ lojix-forged pulls records from criomed
        ▼ rsc projects records → in-memory crate
        ▼ cargo build
        ▼ Put binary bytes → lojix-stored (direct, via token)
        ▼ reply { binary-hash } → criomed
        ▼ criomed asserts a CompiledBinary record in sema
        ▼ reply flows back to human
 human: materialise binary to a path (nix-style), run from shell
        ▼ running binary connects back to nexusd
        ▼ Asserts new records
        ▼ next compile produces a different binary — LOOP CLOSES
```

## 7 · Grammar shape

Nota is a strict subset of nexus. A single lexer (in
nota-serde-core) handles both, gated by a dialect knob. The
grammar is organised as a **delimiter-family matrix** (see
[reports/013](../reports/013-nexus-syntax-proposal.md)):

- Outer character picks the family — records `( )`, composites
  `{ }`, evaluation `[ ]`, flow `< >`.
- Pipe count inside picks the abstraction level — none for
  concrete, one for abstracted/pattern, two for
  committed/scoped.

**Sigil budget is closed.** Six total: `;;` (comment), `#`
(byte-literal prefix), `~` (mutate), `@` (bind), `!` (negate),
`=` (bind-alias, narrow use). New features land as delimiter-
matrix slots or Pascal-named records — **never new sigils**.

---

## 8 · Project-wide rules

Foundational rules observed across sessions.

- **No ETAs.** Don't estimate time to complete work. Describe
  the work; don't schedule it.
- **No backward compat.** The engine is being born. Rename,
  move, restructure freely. Applies until Li declares a
  compatibility boundary.
- **Text only crosses nexusd.** Every internal daemon-to-daemon
  message is rkyv.
- **Schema is the documentation.** Patterns and types resolve
  against sema; hallucinated names are rejected early.
- **Criomed is the overlord.** Bulk data can flow directly
  between forged and lojix-stored, but criomed authorises it
  via capability tokens and retains the reachability view.
- **A binary is just a path.** No `Launch` message;
  materialisation is filesystem.
- **Sigils as last resort.** New features land in the matrix
  or as records. The sigil budget is frozen.
- **One artifact per repo.** rust/style.md rule 1.
- **Content-addressing is non-negotiable.** Record identity is
  the blake3 of its canonical encoding. Don't add mutable
  fields that would break identity.

## 9 · Reading order for a new session

1. **This file** — the canonical shape.
2. [reports/019](../reports/019-lojix-as-pillar.md) — lojix
   as the artifacts pillar; broad-lojix framing; rename table;
   `lojix-schema` crate rationale.
3. [reports/017](../reports/017-architecture-refinements.md) —
   refinements (Opus/Derivation shapes, schema-bound patterns,
   no-Launch, no-kind-bytes, tokens). Some parts superseded by
   019 on type-home (lojix-schema instead of nexus-schema).
3. [reports/013](../reports/013-nexus-syntax-proposal.md) —
   delimiter-family matrix (grammar canon).
4. [reports/015](../reports/015-architecture-landscape.md) v4 —
   full architecture synthesis (parts superseded by 017 — read
   after 017 so you know what's current).
5. [reports/016](../reports/016-tier-b-decisions.md) — open
   questions (most answered by 017).
6. `reports/014` — serde-refactor history.
7. `reports/004`, `reports/009-binds-and-patterns` — technical
   references.

Older reports have been deleted to prevent context poisoning.

## 10 · Update policy

When architecture changes:

1. Update this file first. Keep it prose + diagrams only.
2. Write a new report (`reports/NNN-whatever.md`) describing
   the decision, the alternatives considered, and any concrete
   shapes (types, enums).
3. Update implementation in the affected repos.

If an old report is superseded, **don't edit it** — it stays
as a decision-journey record. The current shape is wherever
this file points.
