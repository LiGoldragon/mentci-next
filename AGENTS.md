# Agent instructions

Tool references live in [`repos/tools-documentation/`](repos/tools-documentation/) — a symlink to `~/git/tools-documentation/` created on `nix develop` / direnv entry.

Start there for: cross-project rules (jj workflow, always-push, Rust style — see [rust/style.md](repos/tools-documentation/rust/style.md)) in [`repos/tools-documentation/AGENTS.md`](repos/tools-documentation/AGENTS.md), and curated daily-use docs for jj, bd, dolt, nix under [`repos/tools-documentation/<tool>/basic-usage.md`](repos/tools-documentation/).

## Architecture

This repo (mentci) is the **dev environment**. The project being built is **criome**.

1. Read [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) at this repo's root for the dev-environment shape.
2. Then read [criome's `ARCHITECTURE.md`](https://github.com/LiGoldragon/criome/blob/main/ARCHITECTURE.md) — the canonical reference for the engine being built (sema, nexus, lojix, criome, prism, lojix-store, signal, …).

Design history and decision records are in [`reports/`](reports/).

**Workspace manifest**: [`docs/workspace-manifest.md`](docs/workspace-manifest.md) lists every repo under `~/git/` with its status. `devshell.nix`'s `linkedRepos` mirrors the CANON + TRANSITIONAL entries.

### Documentation layers — strict separation

| Where | What | Example |
|---|---|---|
| [`criome/ARCHITECTURE.md`](https://github.com/LiGoldragon/criome/blob/main/ARCHITECTURE.md) | **Project-wide canonical.** Prose + diagrams only. No code. High-level shape, invariants, relationships, rules of the engine being built. | "criome owns sema; lojix owns lojix-store; text crosses only at nexus" |
| [`mentci/ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) | **This dev environment.** Workspace conventions, role, layout. Points at criome for the project itself. | "mentci is the dev workshop; long-term it becomes the universal UI" |
| `<repo>/ARCHITECTURE.md` | **Per-repo bird's-eye view.** This repo's role, boundaries (owns / does not own), code map, status. Points at criome for cross-cutting context — does *not* duplicate it. Per the matklad ARCHITECTURE.md convention. | `lojix-store/ARCHITECTURE.md` "owns the `~/.lojix/store/` layout + index DB" |
| [`reports/NNN-*.md`](reports/) | **Concrete shapes + decision records.** Type sketches, record definitions, message enums, research syntheses, historical context. | `Opus { … }` full rkyv sketch |
| the repos themselves | **Implementation.** Rust code, tests, flakes, Cargo.toml. | `nexus-schema/src/opus.rs` |

If a layer rule is violated, rewrite: move type sketches out of `criome/ARCHITECTURE.md` into a report or skeleton code; move runnable code out of reports into the appropriate repo. The architecture stays slim so it remains readable in one pass.

**No report links inside `criome/ARCHITECTURE.md`.** Cross-references go *into* architecture from reports, not *out of* architecture to reports. Reading lists, decision histories, type-spec details all live in reports or in `docs/workspace-manifest.md` — never inline in criome's architecture.

When architecture changes, update `criome/ARCHITECTURE.md` first, then update the affected repos, then write a report only if the decision carries a journey worth recording. Per the project rule "delete wrong reports, don't banner them," superseded reports are deleted — they do not stay as banner-wrapped relics.

### Inclusion/exclusion rule — HARD

**If a repo is not listed as CANON or TRANSITIONAL in the workspace manifest, do not edit its source or docs.** Agents that drift outside the manifest corrupt repos that are either superseded, archived, or outside scope. To add a new canonical repo: update the manifest and `devshell.nix`, write a report, commit.

### AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md pattern

Across all canonical repos we follow: **`AGENTS.md` holds the real content; `CLAUDE.md` is a one-line shim reading "See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)."** This way Codex (which reads `AGENTS.md`) and Claude Code (which reads `CLAUDE.md`) converge on a single source of truth. When creating or restructuring a repo, keep this pattern.

### Per-repo `ARCHITECTURE.md` at root

Every canonical repo carries an `ARCHITECTURE.md` at its root (matklad convention). The file is short — typically 50-150 lines — and answers: *what does this repo do, where do things live in it, and how does it fit into the wider sema-ecosystem.* Standard sections: role, boundaries (owns / does not own), code map, invariants, status, cross-cutting context (link to [criome's `ARCHITECTURE.md`](https://github.com/LiGoldragon/criome/blob/main/ARCHITECTURE.md) and any relevant report).

Per-repo `ARCHITECTURE.md` does **not** duplicate criome's `ARCHITECTURE.md`. It points. Project-wide invariants live once, in criome; per-repo files describe their own niche only. When a repo's role changes, edit that repo's `ARCHITECTURE.md` and (if the change is system-level) criome's `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

When creating a new canonical repo: write `ARCHITECTURE.md` at root before the first commit.

MVP goal: **self-hosting** — write the system's own source as records in the sema database; prism projects those records to `.rs` files (one phase of lojix-daemon's runtime-creation pipeline); rustc compiles them; the new binary reads and extends its own database.

An **opus** is the database's compilation-unit term — one opus compiles to one artifact (library or binary). Corresponds to one Rust crate on the filesystem side.

Write discoveries in [`reports/`](reports/) or in tools-documentation as topic files, don't scatter them across the repo root.

## Report hygiene — don't restate-to-refute

When a frame has been **decisively rejected** (architecture.md §10 "Rejected framings", a bd memory, or a chat correction): do not re-present it as a candidate in subsequent reports just to refute it. State only the correct frame.

When a previous report's premise is **wrong**: delete it and write a clean successor that states only the correct view. Do not append corrections, do not banner, do not restate-to-refute.

The rejected-framings list in [criome's `ARCHITECTURE.md`](https://github.com/LiGoldragon/criome/blob/main/ARCHITECTURE.md) §10 is the *only* place wrong frames are named, and only as one-line entries. Forensic narratives ("here's how this contamination crept in") are not reports — their lessons land in §10 as one-liners and in bd memories; the forensic narrative itself goes too.

## Report rollover at the soft cap

**Soft cap: ~12 active reports** in [`reports/`](reports/). When the count exceeds this, run a rollover pass before adding the next report. For each existing report, decide one of:

1. **Roll into a new consolidated report.** Multiple reports covering the same evolving thread fold into a single forward-pointing successor. The successor supersedes the old reports; the old ones are deleted (no banner).

2. **Implement.** If the report's substance can be expressed as architecture ([criome's `ARCHITECTURE.md`](https://github.com/LiGoldragon/criome/blob/main/ARCHITECTURE.md)), as a per-repo `ARCHITECTURE.md`, as code (skeleton-as-design in the relevant repo), or as an `AGENTS.md` rule, move it to the right home and delete the report.

3. **Delete.** If the report's content is already absorbed elsewhere or its premise has been refuted, delete it.

The choice is made by reading each report against the author's intent — no mechanical rule. When unclear, ask Li.

The cap is **soft** in that it triggers a rollover pass, not an instant rejection; it is **firm** in that the pass must run before the next new report lands. The 2026-04-28 cleanup left `reports/` empty — every active report had been absorbed into `tools-documentation/` topic files, per-repo `ARCHITECTURE.md`s, or code, and the rest were deleted. Default to deletion; extract only when the rationale has no other home.

## Session-response style — substance goes in reports

If the agent's final-session response would be more than very minimal (a few lines), write the substance as a report (in [`reports/`](reports/)) and keep the chat reply minimal — a one-line pointer at the report. Two reasons: (1) the Claude Code UI is a poor reading interface; files are easier; (2) the author reviews responses asynchronously while the agent moves to next work, so the substance must be in a stable, scrollable, file-backed place.

Small reports are fine — the report doesn't have to be large. Acknowledgements, tool-result summaries, "done; pushed" confirmations don't need reports. Anything that explains, proposes, analyses, or summarises does.

**Use relative paths in reports.** When a report references files in sibling repos, link via [`../repos/<name>/...`](../repos/) (the workspace symlinks), not via GitHub URLs. The author reads in Codium and clicks links to open files locally; GitHub URLs break that flow. Absolute paths to `~/git/` also don't open in the editor.

## Components, not monoliths

The workspace is composed of **micro-components** — one capability per crate, per repo, per protocol. **sema** is the database. **criome** is the state-engine around it. **lojix** is the executor (nix, filesystem, deploy). **prism** is the code emitter. **signal** is the wire protocol. **nexus** is the text front-end. Each lives in its own repo with its own `Cargo.toml`, `flake.nix`, and tests; each fits in a single LLM context window; each speaks to its neighbors only through typed protocols.

**Adding a feature defaults to a new crate, not editing an existing one.** The burden of proof is on the contributor (human or agent) who wants to grow a crate. They must justify why the new behavior is part of the *same capability* — not a new one. The default answer is "new crate."

**criome communicates; it never runs.** It does not spawn subprocesses, write files outside sema, invoke external tools, or link code-emission libraries. Effect-bearing work (nix builds, file writes, code emission, deployment) is dispatched as typed verbs to dedicated components. Bundling executor work into criome — or any communicator component — is the failure mode this rule closes.

The full case (historical canon from McIlroy's Unix philosophy through Parnas's information-hiding to Erlang's actor isolation; the catastrophic record of monolith collapse — Twitter, Facebook, Healthcare.gov, government COBOL; the modern LLM-context-window argument) lives in [`repos/tools-documentation/programming/micro-components.md`](repos/tools-documentation/programming/micro-components.md). Read it before pushing back on a "new crate, not new mod" requirement as overhead. The cost of plumbing is minutes; the cost of bundling is months or years of friction no agent and no team will resolve cleanly.

## Beauty is the criterion

Read [`repos/tools-documentation/programming/beauty.md`](repos/tools-documentation/programming/beauty.md) before pushing back on any rule below as "verbose" or "ceremonial." Beauty is not a luxury — it is the test of correctness. Ugly code is evidence that the underlying problem is unsolved. The full case (philosophical foundation across two millennia + the explicit defense from Hardy / Hoare / Dijkstra / Brooks / Hickey / Torvalds + the catastrophic record of what happens when ugly engineering ships — Therac-25, Ariane 5, Mars Climate Orbiter, Heartbleed, Boeing MCAS) lives in [`repos/tools-documentation/programming/beauty-research.md`](repos/tools-documentation/programming/beauty-research.md).

The aesthetic discomfort *is* the diagnostic reading. When something feels ugly, slow down and find the structure that makes it beautiful — that structure is the one you were missing. Per Li (2026-04-27): *"Fuck ugliness and non-conciseness. Who knows how many people were put to death and tortured because someone wasn't concise and explicit enough."*

## Thinking discipline — every reusable verb belongs to a noun

Read [`repos/tools-documentation/programming/abstractions.md`](repos/tools-documentation/programming/abstractions.md) before writing free functions. The discipline applies to any language with method dispatch: behavior lives on types, not as floating verbs. The rule's purpose is to force the question "what type owns this verb?" — when the answer isn't obvious, the model of the problem isn't fully formed yet, and slowing down to find the noun is the load-bearing cognitive event.

Especially load-bearing for LLM-generated code, which lacks the tactile friction that makes humans economize on type creation: declaring a `struct` and declaring a `fn` cost the same number of tokens, so without the rule, agents default to the shorter shape and the noun never gets named. Full research backing in [`repos/tools-documentation/programming/abstractions-research.md`](repos/tools-documentation/programming/abstractions-research.md).

## Naming — full words by default

Identifiers are read far more than they are written. Cryptic abbreviations optimize for the writer (a few keystrokes saved) at the reader's expense (one mental lookup per occurrence). The empirical literature is unanimous on this; the cultural inertia toward `ctx` / `tok` / `de` / `pf` is fossil from 6-char FORTRAN, 80-column cards, and 10-cps teletypes — none of which still apply. See [`repos/tools-documentation/programming/naming-research.md`](repos/tools-documentation/programming/naming-research.md) for the full research.

**Default: spell every identifier as full English words.**

Examples (bad → good):

| bad | good |
|---|---|
| `lex` | `lexer` |
| `tok` | `token` |
| `ident` | `identifier` |
| `op` | `operation` (or specific: `assert_op`) |
| `de` | `deserializer` |
| `pf` | `pattern_field` |
| `ctx` | `context` (or specific: `parse_context`) |
| `cfg` | `config` (or `configuration`) |
| `addr` | `address` |
| `buf` | `buffer` |
| `tmp` | `temporary` (or — better — name what it holds) |
| `arr` | `array` (or — better — what it contains) |
| `obj` | (name what it actually is) |
| `params` | `parameters` |
| `args` | `arguments` |
| `vars` | `variables` |
| `proc` | `procedure` or `process` |
| `calc` | `calculate` |
| `init` | `initialize` |
| `repr` | `representation` |
| `gen` | `generate` or `generator` |
| `ser` / `deser` | `serialize` / `deserialize` |
| `fn` (in identifier) | `function` (the `fn` *keyword* is fine) |
| `impl` (in identifier) | `implementation` (the `impl` *keyword* is fine) |

### Permitted exceptions — tight, named, no others

1. **Loop counters in tight scopes (<10 lines).** `for i in 0..n { ... }` is fine. Beyond ~10 lines or nested, use descriptive names.
2. **Mathematical contexts** where the math itself uses the symbol. `x`, `y`, `z`, `theta`, `phi`, `lambda`, `n` for sample size, `p` for probability — only when the surrounding code or comment establishes the math context.
3. **Generic type parameters.** `T`, `U`, `V`, `K`, `E`. Use a descriptive name when the parameter has non-trivial semantic content.
4. **Acronyms that have passed into general English.** `id`, `url`, `http`, `json`, `uuid`, `db`, `os`, `cpu`, `ram`, `io`, `ui`, `tcp`, `udp`, `dns`. Spell them when ambiguous in context.
5. **Names inherited from std / well-known libraries.** `Vec`, `HashMap`, `Arc`, `Rc`, `Box`, `Cell`, `RefCell`, `Mutex`, `mpsc`, `regex`. Do not rename these; do *not* extend the abbreviation pattern to your own types.
6. **Domain-standard short names already documented in an ARCHITECTURE.md.** `slot`, `opus`, `node`, `frame` are full words and need no exception. If a true short form is load-bearing in the schema, name it in ARCHITECTURE.md so the exception is explicit; otherwise spell it out.

### Rule of thumb (Martin / Linus, combined)

**Name length proportional to scope.** A 3-line loop counter can be `i`. A module-level type that appears across the codebase must spell itself out. A function parameter that lives for 50 lines must read as English.

### What this rule is NOT

- Not "verbose names everywhere" — `calculate_the_total_amount_of_items` is worse than `total_items`. The goal is *clear*, not *long*.
- Not "no acronyms ever" — see exception 4.
- Not "rewrite std" — see exception 5.

### How to apply when generating code

When generating new code: **spell identifiers as full English words by default.** When the surrounding code uses cryptic identifiers: do not propagate them into new code. Either rename (if rename is in scope) or use the full form for new identifiers and flag the inconsistency as a follow-up. Pattern-matching the local dialect is exactly the failure mode this rule exists to break.

### The "feels too verbose" anti-pattern

When a spelled-out name (`AssertOperation`, `Deserializer`, `PatternField`, `RelationKind`) "feels needlessly verbose" — that feeling is **not** a signal to shorten the name. It is a signal that the writer (human or agent) has been **taught wrong** by training data drawn from a 60-year-old culture of card-deck and 80-column-line constraints that no longer apply.

The full word reads as English. The abbreviation reads as ceremony to be decoded. The cost of mis-naming is paid every time the name is read; the benefit of saving three keystrokes is paid once. There is no contest.

Per Li (2026-04-27): *"You were taught wrong. We did a research on this, use it to make the docs convincing so agents don't slip back into writing all this fucking slop garbage-naming bullshit. I REALLY FUCKING HATE IT — IT'S SOOO UGLY!"*

When you catch yourself thinking "this name feels too long" or "this is unnecessarily ceremonial":

1. **Question the feeling.** It is almost certainly inherited prejudice, not informed judgment.
2. **Re-read the name as English.** Does `AssertOperation` read as English? (Yes.) Does `AssertOp` read as English? (No — it requires expansion.)
3. **Apply the rule.** The full English form wins unless the name falls in one of the six named exception classes above.

There is no exception class for "feels verbose." That feeling is the bug, not the criterion.

Backing research: [`repos/tools-documentation/programming/naming-research.md`](repos/tools-documentation/programming/naming-research.md) (the empirical case for full words) + [`repos/tools-documentation/programming/beauty-research.md`](repos/tools-documentation/programming/beauty-research.md) (why beauty in identifiers is the criterion, not keystroke-economy).

## Binary naming — `-daemon` suffix, full English

Long-running daemon binaries carry the `-daemon` suffix:
`nexus-daemon`, `criome-daemon`, `lojix-daemon`. The library
half of the same crate keeps the bare name (`nexus`,
`criome`, `lojix`) — `[lib] name = "nexus"` and `[[bin]] name = "nexus-daemon"`
in the same `Cargo.toml`. CLI binaries that the user
invokes interactively keep bare names (`nexus`, `criome`).

**Why:** `nexusd` / `criomed` are unix-folklore
abbreviations carrying no information beyond the suffix;
the empirical naming-research case applies. `nexus-daemon`
reads as English; `nexusd` requires expansion. It also
disambiguates the daemon binary from the CLI binary at PATH
level (`nexus` the CLI vs `nexus-daemon` the long-running
process).

**How to apply:** when introducing a new daemon, name its
binary `<name>-daemon`. The library half (if any) stays as
the bare name. Per-process stderr log tags also use the
suffix (`nexus-daemon: ready`).

## One-shot binaries — `<crate>-<verb>` for stdin/stdout glue

Beyond the daemon, several crates ship thin one-shot
binaries that wrap a single verb of the library code as a
stdin/stdout filter — useful for test pipelines, agent
harnesses, and debug scripts that need a parser/encoder
without running the daemon.

Naming convention: `<crate>-<verb>`, ~30 LoC each.

| Binary | What it does |
|---|---|
| `nexus-parse` | reads nexus text from stdin, writes length-prefixed signal Frames to stdout |
| `nexus-render` | reads length-prefixed Frames from stdin, writes rendered text to stdout |
| `criome-handle-frame` | reads a Frame, dispatches via `Daemon::handle_frame` against `$SEMA_PATH`, writes reply Frame |

**Why these are not test-only:** they expose useful
affordances of the library code (parser, renderer, handler)
as standalone tools — same shape as `gcc -E` (preprocess
only) shipping alongside `gcc`. Agents and scripts that
manipulate Frames or sema state directly, without a UDS
roundtrip, use them. They live as additional `[[bin]]`
entries in the existing crate, not in a separate test-tools
crate.

**When to add a new one:** when a verb of the library code
is genuinely useful as a filter primitive. Don't create
trivial passthrough binaries.

## Design-doc hygiene — state criteria positively

Avoid polluting design context with "do not use X" patterns. When a candidate is excluded — by constraint, preference, or past decision — **omit it silently** from forward-going context. Don't leave "X is bad because Y," "we ruled out X," or "not X" breadcrumbs across files.

**Why:** design docs and these instructions get loaded into every future agent's context. Every negative statement ("don't use X") costs context budget forever for zero ongoing value — X isn't going to be used; naming it just keeps it alive as a dead option. The accumulated negatives make docs unreadable and teach agents to think about what's excluded instead of what's being built.

Failure mode this closes: agent discovers a constraint ("must be Rust"), accumulates an elimination list ("so not Dolt, not Datomic, not XTDB, not …"), and every future doc re-states the elimination list. Within a few sessions the design context is mostly gravestones.

**How to apply:**
- State criteria **positively**: "must be Rust," not "Go is excluded because …"
- List candidates that **satisfy** the criteria. Silently drop the rest.
- When correcting an earlier wrong direction, the retraction is a one-time edit. Do not leave the retracted direction in the doc "for historical record" — git/jj log preserves it.
- If an excluded option keeps getting re-proposed by agents, that's a signal to **add a positive criterion that silently excludes it**, not to add a rule naming it.
- Applies to: reports, design docs, README-style docs, ARCHITECTURE.md files, AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md.

The **rejected-framings** list in [criome/ARCHITECTURE.md §10](repos/criome/ARCHITECTURE.md) is the *only* place wrong frames are named, and only as one-line entries. Forensic narratives ("here's how this contamination crept in") do not become reports — their lessons land in §10 as one-liners.

## No version history in vision / design / architecture docs

Vision, design, and architecture docs describe what the system IS and what it's heading toward. They do NOT narrate prior abandoned approaches, scaffold history, or "why we restarted." That framing is a self-deprecation reflex that pollutes the doc and dates poorly.

A doc that opens with "this is the third try" is already weaker than a doc that just describes the system. Future readers don't need the lineage; current readers don't either. If a piece of context truly matters (e.g. "the validator pipeline is Datomic-inspired"), state the fact and cite the inspiration — don't frame it as "we abandoned X to get here."

How to apply:
- When rewriting a stale doc, extract the durable ideas + recast in current terms. Drop *all* meta-commentary about the rewrite itself.
- The same rule applies to commit messages of substance — describe the change, not the history of failed attempts.
- Project framing inside docs is "criome" — there is no `criomev3` / `v1` / `v2` distinction in published docs. Version markers are bookkeeping for agents, never for readers.

## Verify each parallel-tool result

When batching tool calls (parallel `Write`, `Edit`, `Bash`), scan each result block for errors **before** any follow-up step that depends on the results. The bundle returning is not the same as the bundle succeeding.

Failure mode: failed `Write` calls (typically the "must Read first" guard) don't show up in subsequent state until something else reads the file. By then the failure has cascaded — a wrong commit, a misled subagent, a published doc that doesn't match what the code reflects.

How to apply:
- After any parallel batch, look at every `<result>` block. If any says "File has not been read yet" or "Exit code N" or `<tool_use_error>`, fix that *before* moving on.
- Double-check by reading the file or running `git status` / `ls` if a write was meant to land.
- Especially load-bearing when the next step is committing, pushing, or spawning an agent that consumes the written file.
- When a `Write` fails on the must-Read-first guard, do the Read then redo the Write before continuing.

## Commit message style — S-expression

Commit messages across all repos under `~/git/` follow a single nested-parenthesis S-expression style.

**Shape:**
- Single line. No blank-line body. Everything fits in the subject.
- First token = repo name (lowercase, as it appears in the filesystem).
- Nested parens group scope → subsystem → notes.
- `[...]` enumerates discrete bullets within a scope.
- `—` (em dash, not `--` or `-`) introduces a rationale or explanation.
- Compound commits wrap the whole thing in an outer pair of parens; simple commits skip the outer pair.
- `((double parens))` mark direct quotes from Li in the message.

**Templates:**

Simple (one concern):
```
(<repo> <short verb-or-label>) (<what changed> — <why>)
```

Compound (multiple concerns):
```
((<repo> <header>) (<scope-A> [<note>] [<note>]) (<scope-B> [<note> — <why>]))
```

**Examples:**
- `(signal edit) (diagnostic.rs + handshake.rs cleanup pass per Li 2026-04-28 ((free functions are incorrectly specified verbs))) (diagnostic.rs — added Diagnostic::error inherent constructor) (handshake.rs — renamed CriomedInstance → CriomeDaemonInstance per the daemon-suffix convention)`
- `(criome edit) (src/daemon.rs + src/main.rs — dropped inherent impl Daemon::start per the new §No ZST method holders rule per Li 2026-04-28)`
- `((mentci edit) (AGENTS.md — added §Style docs are patterns not snapshots above §Adding new docs per Li 2026-04-28 ((links like this dont belong there))) (encodes the rule positively + names the failure mode))`

**Common scope labels:** `add`, `edit`, `cull`, `del`, `fix`, `init`, `rename`, `audit`, `arch edit`, `cleanup`, `impl`, `rewrite`.

The parens do the grouping; em-dashes distinguish explanation from enumeration. Keep it on one line even if long — `jj commit -m '<msg>'` takes arbitrarily long single-line messages. Use double quotes around the message when it contains apostrophes (single quotes terminate the shell string).

## Tooling

`bd` (beads) tracks short items (issues, tasks, workflow). Designs and reports go in files. See [reference_bd_vs_files](repos/tools-documentation/bd/basic-usage.md#bd-vs-files--when-each-is-the-right-home).

`bd prime` auto-runs at session start and gives current state.
